# ParticlePN532

A Particle library port for the PN532 v3 Module by Elechouse.


Most of the original code in this repo was ported from [elechouse's official PN532 repo](https://github.com/elechouse/PN532/tree/master).
The original author created it as an Arduino library, so I adjusted the source to work in the Particle enviornment.


All testing was done on a Photon 2.


## Usage

See the [examples](examples) folder for usage.


## Installation

You can install the `ParticlePN532` library using the Particle CLI or in the Web IDE.
